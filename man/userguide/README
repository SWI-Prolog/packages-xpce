			    The XPCE UserGuide

This directory contains the sources to   the XPCE userguide. To generate
you need a Unix machine with pdflatex.

You also need to install swipl first as this is used for generating part
of the diagrams on the fly.

If all tools are  installed  properly,   a  simple  "make" should create
xpceusg.pdf.
