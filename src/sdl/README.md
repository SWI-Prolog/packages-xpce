# Binding directory for SDL2

This  directory  is  intended  to   provide  a  binding  for  xpce  on
[SDL2](https://www.sdllib.com/).

## Empty binding

This directory was created as a set of "stub" files based on the `msw`
directory that  provides the MS-Windows binding.   The stub prototypes
as  well  as the  stub  implementations  and their  documentation  was
generated by ChatGPT.   The completely empty binding  is accessible at
GIT commit c0d2e19adc4e03adfb9e3ddf2dcdce53f923e081.
