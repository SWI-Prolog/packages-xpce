This file will contain window-system independent  3-d routines, based on
the real low-level routines in  xdraw.c   and  msdraw.c.  Various things
should be abstracted from these modules and  moved into this module. For
now, it contains only the new primitives.

r_3d_rectangular_polygon(int n, IPoint pts, Elevation e, int flags)
	Draws a 3-d polygon.  The current implementation only deals
	with horizontal and vertical lines.  Might be abstracted
	further.
